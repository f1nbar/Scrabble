# Assignment 1
## Approach:
1. Drew out Sprint Plan in diagram to get a clear picture of how the Classes interact.
2. Defined test plan
3. Allocated jobs to each component (Scrum Master for Assignment 1: Finbar Ó Deaghaidh).
4. Implemented tests.
5. Implement components.
6. Tested program.
7. Code review, refactor and refining.
8. Submit executable 1.

## Executable Instructions
1. Launch .jar file (java -jar scrabble-assignment1.jar)
2. Enter name

# Assignment 2
## Approach:
1. Appointed new Scrum Master for sprint (Peter O'Donnell) and allocated tasks.
2. Implemented unit testing methods for all classes before writing the classes themselves.
3. Implemented components with multiple iterations and improvements after reviewing.
4. Introduced any missing unit tests that were required.
5. Wrote Main class to take user input and to give a visual representation of our implementation.
6. Created execuatable Jar and submitted executable 2.

## Executable Instructions
1. Launch .jar file (java -jar scrabble-assignment2.jar)
2. Enter name, pick tile from frame. Places tile in centre of board.
3. Pick tile to move again, pick whether you wish to move vertically or horizontally. This limits your moves to the direction chosen relative to the axis. Pick the coordinates in that direction for your respective tile. 
4. Continue with placing tiles until your frame is empty, turns aren't implemented as of yet.
5. After each move the updated board will be displayed along with the frame.
